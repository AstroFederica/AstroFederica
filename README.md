I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Geneva, and co-leader of the Morphology AGN working group in the ESA Euclid collaboration. As part of the Euclid Early Release Observations Team, since December 2023, I am working on the very first images from the Euclid telescope, analysing the properties of AGN host galaxies in the Perseus Cluster, with a special focus on novel approaches to study dual and binary supermassive black holes.
More precisely, in the perspective of the upcoming data releases, I have been leading a new project studying dual and binary AGNs in the Euclid Survey, and another projects questing for red QSOs in Euclid.
​
I am also co-leading the design of a survey using a new set of medium-band filters of the Subaru telescope, and organising this dedicated workshop.
​
During my education and research I applied mathematical modelling, data analysis and code development in the fields of Particle Physics, Astronomy and Cosmology, using data from the Dark Energy Survey and the CMS experiment at CERN.
With my work I contributed to the study of NGC 4993, the host galaxy of the GW170817 gravitational wave event. I also developed a new method for automated classification of astronomical images, and validated it in collaboration with the Swiss startup Modulos AI.
​
I am active in the field of educational technology, where I design and promote multidisciplinary science learning projects that integrate fundamental science, computer science, computer vision and AI. My EduGame project was shortlisted by the ETH AI Center.
 
As a spin-off of that project, I recently published comic books to teach math and physics, and I am currently working on a comic series for ESA Euclid. Link 1 - Link 2
 
As part of my outreach activities, I often participate in the Swiss Radio television program Millevoci to discuss topics related to space missions, Cosmology and Astrophysics.
