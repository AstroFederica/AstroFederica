Probing AGN activity and host galaxy morphology in the Euclid Survey (February and May 2024)

The Perseus cluster provided the first and most spectacular example to date of radio-mode AGN feedback from a BCG on the surrounding intra-cluster medium. Such feedback is expected to be ubiquitous among galaxy clusters throughout the Universe, but is challenging to identify in large numbers. The Euclid high-resolution imaging opens up the possibility of teasing out point-source AGN emission from host galaxies, and thereby building a census of AGN activity in the Euclid survey. We explore the reliability of this AGN-host decomposition on the members of the Perseus cluster, including the hosts of 13 known X-ray point sources which serve as a reference sample.
For the structural decomposition we carefully account for sources of bias, making sure that our measurements are robust against degeneracies in the multi-dimensional parameter space of galaxy structural properties. We perform multiple fits of increasing complexity, combining one or multiple SÃ©rsic profiles and PSF components, using our newly developed python package named GingaFit.
According to the preliminary results, the addition of a point-source component significantly improves the fitting model, whilst also accounting for the point-source residual. We also analyse the implied point-source luminosity for each cluster member galaxy, integrated over the VIS band, against their host's absolute magnitudes from the bulge and disc components. We are able to isolate two sub-samples, one within the same luminosity-magnitude range of the X-ray sources, and another low-mass sample with high luminosity. Full results will be available in my upcoming publication, showing that such techniques can be used to create an unparalleled census of AGN-hosts in the Euclid survey and applied to future data release to search for and characterise dual and binary AGNs.
